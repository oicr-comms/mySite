  Gliomas account for 80% of all malignant central nervous system cancers and current therapies have shown limited success in treating this maglinancy. Low-grade gliomas (LGGs), are slow-growing but ultimately deadly cancers of the central nervous system. Recent characterization of the mutational landscape of these tumors has led to the identification of LGG into three genetic subtypes. Type I and II LGG harbor a neomorphic mutation in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), however they differ with respect to their mutational landscapes and associated clinical manifestations with type II glioma having a worse prognosis and limited therapeutic options. The molecular pathogenesis underlying type II LGG has dissected that tumor growth is initiated by mutations in IDH, TP53, and ATRX2. 
  
  Currently, there is no mouse model that encompasses the first three truncal events of type II LGG. Thus, I propose to build this tool through a combination of CRISPR gene-editing and Cre-recombinase technologies. I have bred Cre-inducible IDH and TP53 mutant lines together and injected a lentivirus containing Cre and CRISPR elements targeting ATRX into the brains of these animals to recapitulate the initiation  Type II LGG. Preliminary data of these animals has illustrated mild hyperproliferation in brain tissue as well as small tumor nodules, suggesting the initiation of gliomagenesis. This model will allow me to study type II LGG gliomagenesis and may identify novel therapeutic targets and strategies.
