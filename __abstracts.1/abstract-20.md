  Cancer survival rates are significantly improved when patients are diagnosed at an early stage; surgical resection of the tumor can be curative when cancers are still localised to the originating tissue. However effective screening tools capable of detecting cancers at an early stage is only limited to a subset of cancers. Currently, we are investigating the utility of ctDNA for early cancer detection by analysing blood samples collected several months to years prior to a cancer diagnosis. By analysing pre-cancer samples for mutations and methylation aberrations in ctDNA, we can identify early driver events to further our understanding of early tumorigenesis, and to identify potential biomarkers indicative of early or future cancer development. Due to the high background levels of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) released from healthy cells relative to ctDNA in early cancer stages, thus far we have focused on designing a targeted panel for molecular probes to enrich for ctDNA fragments corresponding to mutated driver gene regions or recurrently mutated sites. An initial panel was designed for breast, lung, colorectal and pancreatic panel and assessed on cancer genome sequencing data from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genome (PCAWG) study and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to evaluate how well the targeted panels would capture mutations in the targeted cancer, distinguish between individuals with and without cancers, and across multiple cancer types.
