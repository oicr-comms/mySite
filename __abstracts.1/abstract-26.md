  Introduction
  Hypoxia is prevalent in pancreatic cancer contributing to its treatment resistance and low survival rate. The aim of this study is to investigate if PET imaging with 18F-FAZA can detect hypoxia in pancreatic cancer.
  
  Method
  Twenty patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma underwent dynamic 18F-FAZA PET imaging over 60 min at University Health Network in Toronto. Tumors in 20 and normal tissue in 14 patients were contoured manually by radiologists. The dynamic tissue time activity curves (TACs) were analysed using Patlak and Logan plot for irreversible and reversible binding of 18F-FAZA respectively, and using the flow modified two-tissue compartment model (F2TCM) as proposed by us. Using multivariate logistic regression with backward elimination, the optimal parameter set for distinguishing normal tissue from hypoxic pancreatic tumor was determined. 
  
  Result
  Graphical analysis showed that the tracer was reversibly bound and the distribution volume determined by Logan plot correlated with that determined by F2TCM with R2 = 0.93. F2TCM parameters- distribution volume and dissociation rate constant (k4) separate normal from hypoxic cancerous tissue with sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 71% respectively. 
  
  Discussion
  Besides separating normal from hypoxic malignant pancreatic tissue, the dissociation (k4) and binding (k3) rate constant from kinetic analysis can be associated with MRP-1 activity and nitroreductase and glutathione activity, respectively.
