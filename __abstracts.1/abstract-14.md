  MAPK/ERK signalling pathway is crucial for oncogenesis and its dysregulation by activating mutations in RAS and RAF are major drivers of tumor formation. BRAF inhibitors therefore have had high impact in the treatment of RAF-mutated tumors. However, current BRAF inhibitor drugs display liabilities such as acquired drug resistance and signalling pathway reactivation that can limit their use in the clinic [1]. Thus, new approaches to target BRAF function remain in demand.
  
  Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) has the huge potential to address the various challenges faced in drug discovery. PROTACs are heterobifunctional molecules containing two ligands connected by a linker. Upon binding to both its E3 ligase target and the protein of interest, a PROTAC forms a ternary complex that promotes ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the target protein of interest [2].
  
  Here, we present our recent results on the design and development of small molecule PROTACs against BRAF that function with high potency and remarkable selectivity. In particular, we show that the nature of the protein and ligase ligands, sites of linker connection, linker length and composition have a dramatic effect on PROTAC potency.  These efforts have led to the creation of a modular 'PROTAC toolbox', for use against other proteins of interest.
