  Medulloblastoma (MB) represents the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in childhood cancer. Over the past decade, genomic profiling of primary MBs characterized molecular heterogeneity within MB cohorts and led to subsequent stratification of MB into four core subgroups, each distinct in prognosis and predicted therapeutic response. However, virtually all MB patients who relapse after conventional therapy succumb to their disease, irrespective of subgroup. The paucity of MB samples collected at relapse has hindered the functional understanding of molecular mechanisms driving therapy failure. In this study, we developed a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse-adapted therapy model that has a distinct advantage of generating human, treatment-refractory MB recurrence for each patient profiled. This model allowed comprehensive and dynamic profiling of MB cells at engraftment, after radiation, after chemoradiotherapy and at relapse, through functional stem cell and self-renewal assays, RNA sequencing and gene expression analysis. Comparative gene expression analysis of MB cells collected throughout therapy revealed highly significant upregulation at relapse of a gene never before characterized in the setting of cancer, bactericidal/permeability-increasing fold-containing-family-B-member-4 (BPIFB4). shRNA-mediated knockdown of BPIFB4 led to markedly decreased self-renewal and proliferation of MB cells, as well as extended survival and reduced tumour burden in vivo. Furthermore, a small molecule inhibitor targeting endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), a downstream substrate of BPIFB4, impeded the growth of several MB patient-derived lines at low nanomolar concentrations. For the first time, we describe the role of BPIFB4 as a potent regulator of self-renewal and specific driver of MB relapse. The development of a model that can recapitulate both disease progression and its response to therapy holds great promise to mitigate the rarity of matched primary and recurrent MB samples and guide the development of next-generation targeted therapeutic agents.
