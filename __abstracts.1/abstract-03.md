  Background: Economic analyses of trials often rely on trial-collected health resource utilization data, which is expensive and may be incompletely recorded. We investigated whether administrative data could improve on this.
  
  Methods: Administrative data was linked to Ontario patient data from the Canadian Cancer Trials Group CO.17 trial, evaluating cetuximab plus best supportive care (n = 75 linked Ontario patients) versus best supportive care alone (n = 73). The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) confidence intervals (CI) were determined using bootstrapping.
  
  Results: Among 148 Ontario patients, up to last trial follow-up, administrative data vital status was concordant in > 96%. 29 deaths after trial last follow-up were captured with administrative data. Up to trial last contact there were 50 net additional hospitalizations in administrative data, and 33 net additional emergency room visits. Using administrative data, the ICER was $211,128 per life-year gained (90% CI: $101,396, $694,950), similar to the original economic analysis using trial-collected data ($199,742 (95% CI $125,973, $652,492)).
  
  Conclusions: Administrative data were more complete than trial-collected utilization data, even under optimal conditions. There was also longer follow-up. Our findings illustrate the potential of administrative data sources to relieve institutions, sponsors and patients from the burden of collecting key information which requires considerable effort and cost.
