  Objective: This analysis calculated the mean overall cost per patient per cancer-related medication (CRM) and radiation treatment (RT) by disease and stage in the first year (365 days) after diagnosis. 
  
  Methods: A retrospective cohort study design was used to identify population health system resources and costs for patients diagnosed with breast, colorectal cancer, lung and prostate cancer between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2015. The overall average cost per patient in 365 days after diagnosis was determined for cancer-related medications and RT using two costing algorithms. The cost by disease subtype and stage were determined. 
  
  Results: There were 168,316 Ontarians diagnosed with breast (N=50,141), colorectal (N=38,108), lung (N=34,809) and prostate (N=45,258) cancer. CRM overall mean (95%CI) costs were $8,167 (8,023-8,311); $6,568 (6,446-6,691); $2,900 (2,816-2,984); and $1,211 (1,175-1,247) for breast, CRC, lung and prostate respectively. Mean overall RT costs were $18,529 (18,415-18,643); $15,177 (14,899-15,456); $10,818 (10,669-10,966); and $16,887 (16,648-17,125). Stage III and IV were the most expensive across four cancers for CRM and RT. 
  
  Conclusions: Previous costing and resource estimates have not been robust because of the lack of comprehensive data on CRM and RT. This work updates previous costing estimates to understand resources and costs critical to health system planning in a single payer system.
