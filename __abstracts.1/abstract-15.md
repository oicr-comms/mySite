  Reactome ([https://reactome.org](https://reactome.org)) is an open access curated biological pathway knowledgebase. Its authoritative and detailed content has directly and indirectly supported basic and translational research studies with overrepresentation analysis and network-building tools to discover patterns in genomic data. With user experience firmly in mind, we improved elements of the Reactome web interface to enhance usability, responsiveness and data visualization. We have integrated illustrations that look like overviews of biological processes found in textbooks or review articles, with a consistent iconography with embedded navigation and data overlay functionality. In addition, new versions of the Reactome Functional Interaction (FI) network and ReactomeFIViz Cytoscape app have been released with a suite of new features for pathway- and network-based analysis and visualization. We have expanded our Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) for Reactome pathways to support inference of pathway impacts of somatic mutations affecting protein structures in tumors. Furthermore, we have established an approach to convert Reactome pathways into Boolean networks (BN), and have adapted a fuzzy logic model to perform BN pathway simulation to infer drug and somatic mutation impact. User-intuitive visualization features have been implemented in ReactomeFIViz to help users to perform PGM- and BN-based pathway impact analysis.
