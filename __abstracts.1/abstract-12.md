  Dockstore was used by the TCGA/ICGC Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project to perform uniform alignment and variant calling on over 2,800 cancer donors across 14 HPC and cloud environments. These complex, well-benchmarked variant calling workflows are now available at the Dockstore web site ([https://dockstore.org/](https://dockstore.org/)) for use by the cancer genomics community. Dockstore has recently been adopted as the leading packaging technology by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Cloud workstream, and is now used by numerous third party bioinformatics groups, most notably by participants in the somatic mutation calling in RNA-seq DREAM challenge (SMC-RNA; [https://goo.gl/1Dyfaa](https://goo.gl/1Dyfaa)), and the precisionFDA project ([https://precision.fda.gov/](https://precision.fda.gov/)). We and DNAstack, a Toronto-based company that specializes in cloud-based genome informatics solutions, recently added support to launch a Dockstore workflow in the DNAstack cloud environment. DNAstack is a major contributor to the GA4GH Cloud and Discovery Work Streams, and is developing APIs for launching, tracking and controlling workflows across heterogeneous clouds.
  
  We will further the development of Dockstore with the broad aim of promoting greater collaboration and sharing among computational biology software developers.
