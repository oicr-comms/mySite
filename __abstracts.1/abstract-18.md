  Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is a guideline treatment for Stage I non-small cell lung cancer patients who are inoperable. This option is well tolerated by even unfit patients and has a low recurrence risk post-treatment. However, SABR induces changes in the lung that can appear similar to those of recurrence, and the difference between the two at an early follow-up time point is not easily distinguishable for an expert physician. We hypothesized that a radiomics signature derived from standard-of-care computed tomography (CT) imaging can detect cancer recurrence within six months of SABR. In this study, we performed leave-one-patient out cross-validation experiments with seven classifiers for feature selection and classification on an 81-patient data set. We extracted 127 radiomics features from the consolidative and the peri-consolidative regions on the follow-up CT scans. The best results were achieved using two features selected by the trainable automatic radial-basis Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVMC) for supervised forward feature selection and a nu-based SVMC for classification. This system produced an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.77, an error rate of 22%, a false negative rate of 31%, and a false positive rate of 18%. This suggests that once validated on an external data set, radiomics could reliably detect post-SABR recurrence and form the basis of a tool assisting physicians in making salvage treatment decisions.
