  The study of the origin and development of cerebellar tumours has been hampered by the complexity and heterogeneity of cerebellar cells that change over the course of development. We used single-cell transcriptomics to study >60,000 cells from the developing murine cerebellum, and show that different molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma resemble the transcriptional profile of cells from distinct, temporally restricted cerebellar lineages. Sonic Hedgehog medulloblastoma transcriptionally mirrors the granule cell hierarchy as expected, whereas Group 3-MB resemble Nestin+ve stem cells, and Group 4 medulloblastomas resemble unipolar brush cells. Furthermore, single-cell transcriptomics of human medulloblastoma tumours demonstrates that many bulk tumours contain a mixed population of cells with divergent differentiation. Our data pinpoint possible cells of origin for medulloblastoma subgroups, illustrate a further layer of MB heterogeneity, and allow a comparison of normal and MB transcriptomes to further understand MB biology.
