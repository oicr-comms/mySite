  Advanced stage tumours often exhibit stem cell-like behaviour that is associated with higher aggressiveness and poor response to treatment. Despite the widespread occurrence of this phenomenon, analytical methods for stemness detection that are suitable for use in clinical settings are still not available. We used DNA methylation data and an mRNA-derived stemness score from the TCGA project (GBM+LGG and LUAD) to train machine learning models; these models were used to interpret DNA methylation data (Illumina Infinium 450k and EPIC microarrays) and infer the degree of stemness in tumour samples. As expected, we found that our stemness score sharply differentiates lower grade gliomas from glioblastomas, and also, that high degree of stemness is commonly found in the most advanced lung adenocarcinomas. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the use of machine learning models to interpret DNA methylation data can provide a functional dimension that complements conventional pathological evaluation of tumour samples.
