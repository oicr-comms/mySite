   Approximately 84% of all breast cancers are ER+ at diagnosis. The addition of targeted agents to endocrine therapy has shown significant clinical benefit in ER+ patients. However currently there is a lack of predictive biomarkers to identify which patients should receive treatment with targeted therapy. The goal of this study was to determine whether alterations in specific signaling pathways can be identified and used to stratify breast cancer cell lines to the most effective experimental treatments. Fifteen ER+/HER2- cell lines were characterized using next generation sequencing and were then stratified according to alterations in three key signaling pathways: CCND/CDK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR and FGFR. High-throughput small-molecule screenings were performed to identify the IC50 values of 24 inhibitors across the strata. Variation in inhibitor sensitivity was observed between cell lines based on molecular alterations. Cell lines with a PIK3CA mutation in combination with a CDK-pathway alteration were more sensitive to CDK inhibitors than cell lines with alterations in the CDK-pathway alone or PIK3CA mutations alone In addition, cell lines with the dual alterations demonstrated stronger synergy between CDK and PI3K-pathway inhibitors compared to either alteration alone. The results suggest that stratification according to molecular alterations in specific signaling pathways may predict sensitivity to targeted inhibitors in a panel of ER+/HER2- breast cancer cell lines.
