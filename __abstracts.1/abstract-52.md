  Over the last four years, OICR in collaboration with the Earlham institute has developed a production grade LIMS system called MISO (Managing Information for Sequencing Operations). MISO is fully open and is used in daily operations for sample tracking at both institutes. We've expanded the system to support Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing instruments and have used it for a project focused on detection of chromosomal rearrangement breakpoints. This type of detection is currently challenging and has a long turnaround time with standard NGS.  We describe here both the extensions developed for our MISO system, and the analysis of Oxford Nanopore sequencing data. We applied whole genome long read sequencing using the ONT MinION platform for detection of chromosomal rearrangements on parental genomic DNA and embryonic DNA to screen for balanced euploid embryos to achieve high implantation and low miscarriage rates. A novel analysis pipeline allowed us to detect breakpoints for abnormalities previously discovered through cytogenetics with a mean genome coverage of 3.5x, and an average read length of 4kb. The full sequence of the breakpoints was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. We were able to detect embryos that were carriers of balanced chromosomal rearrangements. Inclusion of ONT sequencing information in MISO will allow us to automate these analysis pipelines, an important step as we begin more routine processing of data from these types of experiments.
