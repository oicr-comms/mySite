   Introduction: Post-radiotherapy prostate cancer recurrence often occurs at dominant intraprostatic lesions (DILs), motivating focal dose escalation. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has demonstrated potential for DIL localization. We addressed the question: when targeting dose escalation to mpMRI-defined DILs, what is the dose increase to the cancer defined on corresponding histology?
   
   Methods: We registered annotated post-prostatectomy histology to pre-prostatectomy mpMRI from eight patients. We registered each mpMRI to 1-3 (of 14) transrectal ultrasound images of other patients with high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) catheters, thus registering mpMRI-defined DILs and underlying histologic cancer to the treatment plans. We adjusted dwell times for maximum safe focal dose escalation to the mpMRI DILs.
   
   Results: We analyzed 16 mpMRI DIL-targeted HDR-BT plans. The median [interquartile range] dose increase to the MRI DILs was 2.86 [1.93-3.84] Gy (range 0.62-5.52 Gy). Respectively on histology: 0.42 [0.053-2.11] Gy, (range -0.86-5.2 Gy). mpMRI DIL contouring inaccuracy and inter-plan catheter location variability contributed to lower histologic dose escalation.
   
   Conclusion: mpMRI DIL targeting moderately increased the radiation dose to underlying histologically-defined cancer using dwell time manipulation of whole-gland clinical plans. Improved DIL contouring accuracy and targeted catheter placement may be important to increasing the efficacy of focal boosting.
