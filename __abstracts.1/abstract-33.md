   While cancers share common traits that accumulate progressively through somatic evolution, the evolutionary forces catalyzing the transition of a healthy cell to a cancerous state remains unclear. Studies reveal that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) accumulate somatic mutations as a function of regular aging (Age-Related Clonal Hematopoiesis; ARCH). Some mutations confer a fitness advantage causing HSCs to expand and contribute disproportionately more to the mature blood cell pool. However, ARCH associates with blood-based cancers and cardiometabolic conditions and, as a pre-disease state, affords us the opportunity to characterize evolutionary forces contributing to disease development. Here, we use deep-coverage sequencing data and paired clinical outcomes from 100 pre-AML samples and 400 age-matched controls to develop computational models to characterize somatic evolution by repurposing classic population genetic tools. We employ a comparative Bayesian approach to determine selection parameters shaping intra-individual accumulation of somatic mutations. We identify instances where evolutionary models depart from neutrality, are characteristic of deleterious selection, and can calibrate the rate and timing of driver mutations and their association with cancer outcomes. These models will inform analytical approaches in deep coverage sequencing, and provide a rich description of temporal evolutionary processes to predict which clinical outcome a sample is destined towards.
