  Male breast cancer (BCa) accounts for less than 1% of all BCas and 1% of all cancers in males. Clinical management is largely extrapolated from female BCa. Several multigene assays are used to guide treatment decisions in female BCa, however their utility or the mutational landscape in male BCa is largely unknown. 380 ER+ve, HER2-ve male BCa patients enrolled in the International Male Breast Cancer Program, were profiled using a custom Nanostring panel of genes from the commercial risk tests Prosigna, OncotypeDx and Mammaprint, to generate comparable risk scores and intrinsic subtyping data. Also, targeted sequencing of 150 patients using the Oncomine Comprehensive Assay v3 was performed to identify variants in cancer driver genes, shown to be prognostic and predictive for current targeted therapies. Survival analyses showed patients classified as high-risk possessed poor relapse-free survival compared to those classified as low-risk across all tests.  Preliminary targeted sequencing identified frequent variants in PIK3CA, as well as copy number (CN) changes in CCDN1, FGF3, FGF19, FGFR1 and MYC. Residual risk assessment tests, validated in female BC, provide similar information in male BC with a similar spectrum of gene mutation and CN aberrations.  To our knowledge, this is the largest study of male BCas to assess the clinical utility of commercial BC risk tests and first to use a clinically validated precision medicine targeted sequencing panel for actionable mutations.
