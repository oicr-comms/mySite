  Background: CanIMPACT is a CIHR funded multidisciplinary team using a multi-method approach to improve care coordination for patients with cancer. 

  Purpose: We describe patient and caregiver contributions to the creation of visual synthesis maps as part of CanIMPACT Phase 1. 

  Methods: Investigators and the Patient Advisory Committee (PAC) worked with OCAD University's Strategic Innovation Lab to create two synthesis maps for knowledge translation of the patient's cancer experience. PAC members contributed to map design through interviews and critique of draft maps.

  Results: Two synthesis maps were created: one map illustrated the clinical cancer care continuum in Canada based on data derived from CanIMPACT; the second map, 'Patient as Person in Relationship-Centred Care' described the cancer journey from the patient's perspective. Both maps trace the continuum from pre-diagnosis to survivorship. The patient map illustrated the complex ways in which cancer impacted patients' lives including interactions with their physicians, other healthcare providers, and with family, friends, and broader social networks.
  
  Conclusion: The PAC was instrumental to the creation of both synthesis maps and highlighted the importance of the patient/caregiver perspective in creating visual representations of the patient's cancer journey.
