  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) accounts for approximately 25% of all breast neoplasms.  Believed to be a precursor to invasive carcinoma, a significant number of patients are well-managed by surgery alone or with radiotherapy and endocrine therapy. Although mastectomy, breast conserving surgery, and radiotherapy can reduce the risk of recurrence, there are ongoing lifetime consequences of treatment.  Thus, there is a clinical need to identify those who are at risk of an invasive recurrence from those who might not recur or experience a DCIS recurrence. In this study, 60 patients with primary DCIS, treated with only with breast conserving therapy, across three different clinical outcome groups were examined: patients who did not experience a recurrence at 5 years; patients with a recurrent DCIS at 5 years; and patients with an invasive cancer at 5 years.  DNA from the primary DCIS as well as the matched DCIS or invasive recurrence were profiled using a clinically validated targeted sequencing panel, the Oncomine Comprehensive Assay v3. This panel is comprised of common cancer driver genes shown to be prognostic and predictive to targeted therapies currently in use or in late phase clinical trials.  Here we present the preliminary findings mapping the mutational and copy-number changes of primary DCIS and matched recurrences to identify putative genomic aberrations defining these clinical outcome groups, and to investigate the genomic progression of DCIS to invasive carcinoma.
