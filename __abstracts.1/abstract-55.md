  Prostate cancer is the second most common non-skin cancer among Canadian men. A common treatment technique for intermediate and high-risk localized prostate cancer is high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy (BT). This minimally invasive procedure relies on accurate identification of needle tips to ensure patient safety and delivery of the prescribed radiation dose. Image artifacts from nearby needles and the surrounding tissue often limit the accuracy of needle tip identification when using standard ultrasound (US) image guidance. To overcome these limitations and improve the accuracy of intraoperative needle tip identification, we propose the use of power Doppler (pD) US imaging while a mechanical perturbation is applied to the needle of interest. A mock procedure employing the standard clinical workflow was completed in a tissue-mimicking agar phantom. Inserted needles were imaged using standard US, followed by pD imaging while a custom-made device was used to perturb the needle. Physical measurements of the needle end lengths were used to estimate insertion depth errors (IDEs). 13 unobstructed needles and 10 shadowed needles were imaged using standard and pD US, resulting in mean IDEs ± SD of 2.2 ± 0.9 mm and 1.3 ± 0.9 mm, respectively, for unobstructed needles, and 2.1 ± 1.6 mm and 1.6 ± 1.2 mm for shadowed needles. Mean IDEs were reduced in all cases when pD imaging was used, suggesting our method may be useful in improving HDR-BT treatment accuracy and patient safety.
