   WD repeat (WDR) proteins, currently emerging oncology targets, belong to a large conserved family involved in cancer-associated pathways by acting as scaffolds for multi-protein complexes essential for cancer cell survival. According to recent genome-wide shRNA dropout screens, the WDR protein Cell Division Cycle 40 (CDC40) was identified to be crucial for the growth of lung cancer cell. Although CDC40 appears to be involved in both spliceosome C complex formation and cell cycle control, its exact mechanism(s) remain unknown. To validate the essentiality of CDC40 in lung cancer cell line growth and survival, a lentivirus-based, doxycycline-inducible shRNA system was delivered into lung cancer lines. We observed CDC40 protein knockdown as soon as 24h after shCDC40 induction, followed by a G2/M cell cycle arrest at 48h. This led to Caspase 3/7 activation and an anti-proliferative phenotype at 72h. Localization of CDC40 within the spliceosome C complexes suggests a crucial role in mRNA splicing. However, CDC40 knockdown does not alter the stress-induced splicing of the XBP1 gene, suggesting potential selectivity in CDC40-induced splicing mechanisms. These results indicate the importance of CDC40 for lung cancer cell growth and survival, and points to a need for further investigation into how CDC40 participates in splicing activity (i.e. constitutive and/or alternative splicing) as well as cell cycle progression, which could lead CDC40 to a therapeutic target for lung cancer.
