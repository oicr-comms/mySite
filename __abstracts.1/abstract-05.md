  **Introduction:** Detection of tumour hypoxia with PET imaging with 18F-labelled hypoxia agents is a promising clinical method for stratification of patients in personalized cancer medicine. The quantification of tumour hypoxia, known as the hypoxic fraction, typically relies on a count of the number of tumour voxels above a threshold activity.
  
  **Methods:** To simulate various levels of tumour hypoxia as well as reference regions for comparison (i.e. blood, muscle) a phantom was developed consisting of a set of two plates separated by 2mm acrylic rods. The phantom contains four regions; a 'normoxic' surrogate region and 3 regions representing various 'hypoxic tumour' geometries. The phantom was circulated among 7 different sites (and 9 PET scanners) in North America as part of a QIN Challenge launched by our group.

  **Results:** The phantom produced histograms resemble those of clinical tumours, having both 'normoxic' and 'hypoxic' regions. Hypoxia thresholds were calculated using a range of literature values from 1.1-1.3 times the surrogate region as well as noise based techniques.  To date 6 institutions have scanned the phantom using 3 sets of reconstructions. For the same region the range of calculated hypoxic fractions ranged between 18.9-99.2%.

  **Conclusions:** This phantom is able to help quantify differences in hypoxia measurements between sites and is sensitive enough to detect differences in hypoxic fraction even on the same scanner with different reconstruction techniques.
