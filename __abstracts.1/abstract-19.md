  Myelofibrosis (MF) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by bone marrow fibrosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis and significant risk for leukemic transformation. Most patients carry recurrent MPN driver mutations in JAK2, CALR and MPL and many carry additional mutations in epigenetic regulator, splicing and signaling pathways. However, the functional nature and cellular identity of the MF clone(s) bearing mutations that initiate and maintain the disease over time has not been well characterized, making targeted therapies elusive. Therefore, here we used a 54-gene targeted sequencing panel to identify somatic variants present in the peripheral blood of 10 MF patients at the time of diagnosis. Next, we used ddPCR to track these variants in stem and mature cells sorted from primary samples collected at serial timepoints, as well as in cells sorted from patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). We reveal that the vast majority of tracked variants were acquired in immunophenotypically defined hematopoietic stem/multipotent progenitor cells (CD45+34+38-RA-, termed MF-HSCs). All variants acquired in this compartment were maintained over longitudinal follow-up. Importantly, PDXs underscore the functional and genomic heterogeneity of the MF-HSC pool and when taken together with primary data, elucidate the order of mutation acquisition in select samples. Collectively, our data point to rare MF-HSCs as therapeutically relevant disease-initiating and sustaining cells.
