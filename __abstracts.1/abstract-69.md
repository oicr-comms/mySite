  The Cancer Genome Collaboratory is an academic compute cloud designed to enable computational research on the world's largest and most comprehensive cancer genome dataset, the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC).  A subproject of ICGC, the PanCancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) alone has generated over 800TB of harmonized sequence alignments, variants and interpreted data from over 2,800 cancer patients. By making the ICGC data available in cloud compute form in the Collaboratory, researchers can bring their analysis methods to the cloud, yielding benefits from the high availability, scalability and economy.
  
  To facilitate the computational analysis on the ICGC data, the Collaboratory has developed software solutions that are optimized for typical cancer genomics workloads, including well tested and accurate genome aligners and somatic variant calling pipelines. The Collaboratory is actively growing, with a target hardware infrastructure of over 3,500 CPU cores and 15 petabytes of raw storage. As of Feb 2019, the Collaboratory holds information on 1,947 PCAWG donors (722TB total) and additional 2,679 non-PCAWG donors (300TB total). We anticipate expanding the Collaboratory to host the entire ICGC dataset (approximately 5PB) and to extend analysis facilities across multiple clouds. The Collaboratory has been open to the public in the third quarter of 2017. We invite cancer researchers to learn more about our cloud resources, and apply for access.
