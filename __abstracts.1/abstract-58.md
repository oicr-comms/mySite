  Image-guided biopsy is crucial for diagnosis and presurgical planning of women with breast cancer. High resolution breast functional imaging with positron emission mammography (PEM) demonstrates increased sensitivity for detecting breast tumours compared to conventional modalities and techniques. We aim to extend the use of PEM imaging by integrating it with an ultrasound-guided biopsy technique to improve sampling of breast tumours. A new guidance device was designed to operate between PEM detector plates. The design features in-plane imaging of the target lesion with the needle tip (in postfire configuration) positioned at its remote-center-of-motion. In this pilot study, we validated the mechanical bias and biopsy accuracy using the guidance device. Mock biopsy procedures were performed on a tissue-mimicking agar breast phantom with embedded cylindrical targets (2mm, 4mm, and 6mm in diameter). The biopsy needle was guided in real-time using ultrasound and postfire images were acquired. Preliminary results with 10 biopsy trials demonstrated that the mean mechanical bias was 0.42¬±0.27mm. The biopsy accuracy in 5 samples each was 100% for 2mm, 4mm, and 6mm targets. Future work will examine mechanical bias and biopsy accuracy as a function of target diameter and depth. This validation of the guidance device will allow us to determine the limits necessary for sampling and conclusive diagnosis of small lesions when implemented on an advanced PEM system.
