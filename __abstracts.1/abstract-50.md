  Liver cancer is the second and sixth most frequent cause of cancer mortality worldwide in men and women, respectively, with high prevalence in under developed and developing countries. Minimally invasive focal ablation of liver tumors is an alternative technique to resection and transplantation for early-stage cancer and is focused on reducing patient complications and recovery times. Although promising, the therapeutic benefits are currently present with high local cancer recurrence. One potential source of error arises when performing therapy applicator guidance with 2D ultrasound (US) since the field-of-view is limited and requires the physician to build a mental image of the anatomy. Our solution to this limitation has been the development of a novel mechanically assisted 3D US imaging and guidance system capable of providing geometrically variable images.
  
  A three-motor mechanical mover was designed to provide linear, tilt, and hybrid geometries with adjustable ranges of motion for variable 3D US fields-of-view. This mover is held by a counterbalanced mechanical ""arm and wrist"" which contain electromagnetic brakes and five encoders to track the position of the transducer. This mechanical support is mounted on a portable cart with coarse adjustable height to accommodate gross differences in patient sizes. This work represents the evaluation on the image reconstruction, tracking system accuracy, software implementation, and qualitative human volunteer scans.
