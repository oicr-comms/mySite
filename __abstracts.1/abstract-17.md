  Knowledge regarding the in vivo localization, quantification and persistence of antigen presenting cell- (APC)-based immunotherapies following adoptive transfer is predictive of the ensuing anti-tumor immune response. Unfortunately, the lack of a suitable imaging modality with clinical translation potential to help answer these unknowns is hindering the advancement of such immunotherapies. Our laboratory investigates [19F]-Fluorine (19F) cellular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a quantifiable and non-invasive imaging technique to track in vivo APC-based immunotherapeutic cell migration and thus, serve as a surrogate marker of vaccine effectiveness. APC-based therapeutic cells were generated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and rendered in vivo-detectable through near 100% 19F-based cell labeling agent incorporation into PBMC without affecting viability or phenotype. Using this model, we report consistent detection and quantification of 19F-labeled PBMC migration to draining lymph nodes in mice and demonstrate that 19F cellular MRI is sensitive enough to discern differences in in vivo migration associated with varying therapeutic cell ex vivo culture conditions. Lastly, we successfully characterized the cell lineage proportions of lymph node-migrated PBMC to help answer fundamental questions regarding which cell lineages and/or phenotypes are crucial in launching robust and sustained anti-tumor immune responses.
