   Immunotherapy is rapidly moving to the forefront of cancer therapy with widespread clinical success and low toxicity profiles. However, we are seeing immunotherapy to be most successful in cancers with high rates of cell turnover and high mutational load. We aim to identify factors that allow a tumour to respond to immunotherapy treatments so that patients with solid tumours, such as breast tumours, may also benefit from this highly efficacious therapy. We have employed a chemotherapy cocktail, FEC (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide) and initial in vivo studies suggest synergistic activity between FEC and our oncolytic virus (oHSV-1 ICP0 null). Furthermore, in vivo studies assessing the ability of triple combination therapy with FEC, oHSV-1 and checkpoint blockade antibodies resulted in prolonged overall survival and durable cures, suggesting an immune-mediate mechanism of action. RNA sequencing of mice treated with FEC and oHSV-1 shows upregulation of many genes and pathways associated with the B cell lineage. Immunohistochemistry of tumours treated with FEC and oHSV-1 shows formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) with dense infiltration of T cells throughout the core of the structures and B cells around the periphery. Further studies will aim to assess the importance of B cells to our therapeutic efficacy and the role they play in TLS formation.
