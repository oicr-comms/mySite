  A key insight in the understanding of cancer in past decades has been that the disease can differ quite significantly between individuals. Patients with even the same diagnosis can experience differing therapeutic responses due to underlying tumoural heterogeneity. This insight has altered how oncologists think, inspiring a paradigm shift from one-size-fits-all treatment to individualized therapy that takes into account the genetic and experiential profile of a patient. This shift can be attributed in part to the outsize impact that the data revolution has had on medical research. While exciting, taking advantage of these online resources brings with it new problems. Digestion of the available information in a timely and accurate manner is a particular challenge. It is with this challenge in mind that OICR and FACIT have collaborated in the development of Heliotrope. Heliotrope is a web application designed to support therapeutic decision-making for oncologists. Interpretation of patient genomic data has been its primary focus, with an emphasis on highlighting biomarkers, such as nucleotide variants and copy number changes, that have known therapeutic or clinical interventions. Additionally, a knowledge base provides gene, variant, drug and clinical trial information. By harmonizing clinical and academic research and tailoring the output to a specific patient, Heliotrope can simplify and hasten therapeutic decision-making while improving it's efficacy.
