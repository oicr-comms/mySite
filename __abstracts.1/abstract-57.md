  Pancreatic cancer continues to have the highest mortality rate of all solid cancers. Immune checkpoint blockade remains ineffective, despite progress in other tumours. There remains a subset of patients displaying increased CD8+ tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), despite absence of specific mutational signatures related to increased mutational burden. Recent studies have focused on antigen presenting cells (APCs), particularly Batf3+ dendritic cells (DCs), and their role in priming and chemokine-mediated recruitment of cytotoxic T cells into tumours. In this study, we analyzed 78 treatment-na√Øve primary pancreas cancer resections for associations between CD8+ TILs and chemokine expression by RNAseq. We found CXCL9 and CXCL10 to be amongst the most highly associated chemokines (p < 0.001). When we segregated 173 patient samples, those with higher expression had increased signatures involved with antigen presentation, Batf3+ DC presence, and T cell/APC co-stimulation (p < 0.001), while no differences in SNV counts nor neoantigens were observed. These results were consistent across ICGC and TCGA data sets, and were also consistent in 72 liver metastases. Together, these results implicate a potential role of CXCL9 and CXCL10 in CD8+ T cell recruitment in pancreatic cancer. Understanding mechanisms that drive CD8+ T cell infiltration in pancreatic cancer may lead to novel therapies converting patients with cold tumours into those amenable to current and novel immunotherapies.
