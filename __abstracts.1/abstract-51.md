  Over the last 10 years, the OICR Drug Discovery Department has assembled thematically related collections of compounds for screening. Building upon the success we have had with one such collection, the Kinase Inhibitor Library, we now wish to highlight the availability of a second major collection of compounds, called the OICR Tool Compound Library (TCL) for screening in various assays.
  
  The criteria considered in including a tool compound in the TCL include whether the compound is (1) in the clinic (2) known to be the tool compound for a specific non-kinase target, or (3) contains a distinct chemotype.
  
  The library can be tested using two different approaches. When screening is performed on a phenotypic assay, hits can help quickly identify a mechanistic ""driver' for the oncogenic phenotype. Alternatively when a screen is done on a specific protein target, hits can provide excellent starting points for generating analogues to help further optimize the series and develop new intellectual property against a novel target.
  
  A key class of targets that have attracted much recent attention in oncology and other diseases, are epigenetic targets. In order to have a readily available focused set of compounds that targets this emerging class of proteins, a subset of compounds from the TCL were curated that specifically target epigenetic proteins. The growing library, called the Epigenetic Compound Library, now contains at least 240 compounds.
