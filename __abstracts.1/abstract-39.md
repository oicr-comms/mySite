   The tumor promoting functions of proteins involved in cancer can often be the result of their interactions with other proteins. A reference of the complete protein-protein interactome is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships and cancer. Currently available human protein interactome maps are incomplete and biased. The Human Reference Protein Interactome Mapping Project, being carried out by The Center for Cancer Systems Biology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, aims to systematically test all pairwise combinations of human protein-coding genes for interactions between them. Currently, this dataset consists of 53,000 protein-protein interactions involving 8,300 proteins. Here we present the web portal that host this dataset, in addition to interactions curated from literature, allowing researchers to query, download, and analyze high quality protein-protein interactions networks. Features of the web portal include query and filtering options, visualization of network results,  GO enrichment of the network results, and exportation of network results to external analysis tools including Reactome, cBioPortal, and gProfiler, among others. In future the web framework used to host this dataset, openPIP, will be openly available for researchers to host their own PPI data in their own instance of the web-portal. The web-portal can be accessed at interactome.baderlab.org.
