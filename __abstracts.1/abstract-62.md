  Our group aims to develop subgroup-specific models of medulloblastoma, the most common malignant paediatric brain tumour. Based on molecular signatures, these tumours can be categorized into 4 main subgroups: WNT, SHH, group 3 and group 4. However, reliable genetic models do not exist for most of these subgroups. Furthermore, standard mouse models prohibit large scale screens for novel therapeutic agents as well as live imaging of tumour cell behaviour. To address these issues, we have been generating zebrafish models of medulloblastoma. Zebrafish have become a widely adopted, and highly complementary, research tool for modelling human disease. Notably, zebrafish embryos and larvae are optically transparent and develop externally, such that fluorescently labeled cells can be imaged in real time. In addition, the fecundity, small size and aquatic environment of this model organism are key advantages in high-throughput drug screens. Currently, two approaches are being used to develop medulloblastoma models: 1) targeted overexpression of subgroup-specific drivers in the cerebellum; and 2) use of CRISPR/Cas9 to delete tumour suppressors in a p53 null background. Progress in these areas will be presented.  Ultimately, a genomic analysis of zebrafish models of medulloblastoma and other cancers, in particular glioblastoma, will allow identification of highly conserved regulators of disease progression and identification of therapeutic targets.
