  Standard-of-care treatment for gynecologic malignancies typically includes aggressive radiation to avoid more morbid surgery and may require brachytherapy to escalate dose delivered to the tumour relative to surrounding tissues. In high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT), multiple hollow needles must be precisely placed through a perineal template to optimize the dose and avoid overexposure of nearby organs-at-risk (OAR), such as the bladder and rectum. There is currently no standard approach for intraoperative localization of needles, which would allow implants to be assessed in the procedure room, providing the potential to improve implant quality and avoid OAR. We have developed an accessible intraoperative 3D ultrasound (US) system that provides a versatile method to verify needle placement. The system includes the capability for endfire scanning, as well as a sidefire acquisition mode that can be used to generate a fan-shaped transrectal US image or a ring-shaped 360Â° 3D transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) image with both sidefire techniques tested in patient studies. Additionally, to ease the intraoperative localization of the needles, an automatic needle segmentation algorithm has been implemented and tested on patient TVUS images. The system provided a versatile and accessible method for needles to be clearly visualized and localized relative to nearby OAR, enabling intraoperative implant assessment during gynecologic ISBT.
