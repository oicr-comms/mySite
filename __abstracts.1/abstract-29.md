  Despite a thorough genetic characterization of patient tumors, there has been little progress in improving survival for glioblastoma (GBM) patients since the implementation of temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy. Genetic heterogeneity, resistance to chemotherapy and inefficient drug delivery are key barriers to successful development of GBM therapies. To identify new therapeutic strategies, a comprehensive picture of genetic vulnerabilities and mechanisms of chemotherapeutic resistance across this heterogenous cancer is needed. We have performed a series of genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens in a panel of patient-derived glioblastoma stem cell lines identifying core, recurrence-specific and genotype specific genetic vulnerabilities. We identify genes and pathways regulating stemness and stress response as key vulnerabilities point to new tactics for therapeutic intervention in glioblastoma. Chemogenomic screens using the standard of care agent TMZ affirm mutation of MMR genes as a key mechanism of acquired drug resistance and identify novel candidate targets for combination therapy such as the MCM8-9 helicase complex and the previously uncharacterized stress-responsive RNA binding protein ZC3H7A. Ongoing validation of screen results using genetic perturbation and small molecule/drug treatment across panels of patient-derived GBM stem cell lines provides increased biological insight and opportunities for future therapeutic exploitation for this devastating and incurable cancer.
