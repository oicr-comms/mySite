   BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to show the demographics and investigate the cost of the Trillium Drug Program (TDP) for an oncology patient population. 
   
   METHODS: All TDP claims between April 1997 and December 2016 were ascertained from the Ontario Drug Benefit database to assess utilization and cost. Drugs were classified as a cancer treatment drug, cancer supportive therapy drug or non-cancer drug. We also identified a cohort of cancer patients with least one TDP claim, for which we examined demographics and claims-related characteristics. 
   
   RESULTS: 50,975,293 TDP claims were made over the study period, totalling $4.8 billion. Although the proportion of cancer claims among all TDP remained constant, the total annual cost of cancer treatment drugs increased ~50-fold from 1997-2016. Imatinib and lenalidomide together made up ~half of the cost of all cancer treatment drugs. From TDP claims, we identified 37% of 49,892 cancer patients enrolled in the TDP prior to their cancer diagnosis; they were more likely to be in lower income quintiles and have more chronic conditions. Differences were also found in the distribution of cancer diagnoses between these two groups.
   
   INTERPRETATION: Our study characterizes TDP utilization and shows an increase over time and differed across cancer diagnoses and drugs. These results have public health and policy implications as antineoplastic drug costs continue to rise and place burden on patients.
