  Pancreas cancer is a lethal malignancy with a 5-year survival rate less than 10%.  Characteristic high stromal density limits molecular analysis. We demonstrate that pre analytical enrichment of pancreas cancer cells by laser capture microdissection improves whole genome (WGS) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis. The study was approved by UHN and OICR institutional review boards. Snap frozen pancreas cancer samples were obtained from consented patients undergoing surgical resection or needle core biopsy. Tumours were microdissected from hematoxylin-stained tissue sections and collected into extraction buffer.  Nucleic acids were extracted and submitted for sequence analysis. Reference DNA was obtained from blood or normal tissue. Tumour cellularity of 40% or more by WGS was required for successful analysis. Average cellularity of 72 resected tumours microdissected prior analysis was 73% (range 25-95%). By comparison, mean cellularity of 12 bulk tumours was 35% (range 20 - 52%). Similar results have been obtained from more than 300 microdissected patient tumours. This included tumours with high stromal density which might otherwise have failed sequencing, and needle core biopsies from patients with advanced disease.  In most cases, sufficient quantity and quality DNA and RNA were obtained for successful WGS and RNAseq analysis. The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility and utility of microdissection for enrichment of  pancreas tumour cells prior to sequencing.
