   Our group and others have shown that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells have unique mitochondrial characteristics that can be therapeutically targeted. Through an shRNA screen for new mitochondrial targets in AML cells, we identified the protease, neurolysin (NLN). NLN is a zinc metalloprotease whose mitochondrial function is not well understood and whose role in AML has not been previously reported.
   
   Using gene expression datasets and immunoblotting, we found that NLN is overexpressed in a subset of AML patient samples compared to normal hematopoietic cells. To validate the results of our shRNA screen, we genetically knocked down NLN in AML cells. NLN knockdown reduced the growth of leukemic cells and progenitors.
   
   To gain insight into NLN's function, we investigated NLN's protein interactors using proximity-dependent biotin labeling (BioID). NLN interacted with several proteins involved in mitochondrial function and structure. Consistent with this finding, knockdown of NLN impaired oxygen consumption and respiratory chain supercomplex (RCS) formation.
   
   As a chemical approach to assess the effects of NLN inhibition, we treated AML cells with the small molecule NLN inhibitor, R2. R2 impaired RCS formation and showed anti-AML activity in vitro and in vivo.
   
   Thus, we discovered that the mitochondrial protease NLN regulates oxidative metabolism by controlling the assembly of RCS. Moreover, we highlight NLN as a potential new therapeutic target for AML.
