  The effectiveness of targeted cancer regimen or immunotherapy could be limited by the heterogeneous spatial distributions of cancer cells and infiltrating tumour lymphocytes (TILs).  As such, development of a tool that can distinguish sub-populations of cancer cells and TILs, and enables visualization and measurement of their spatial distributions, will be invaluable for assessing and monitoring patients' immune and cancer profiles before and during therapy.  Here we report the use of an in situ protein marker multiplexing immunofluorescence system (MxIF) to phenotype both cancer cells and TILs in breast and ovarian cancer.  An FFPE section of a breast cancer tissue microarray (TMA) was stained with 9 markers (ER, PgR, HER2, KI67, P53, P21, P16, CD8, CD20) with MxIF.  A total of 114 cores were analyzed with 304,102 single cancer cells segmented.  Quantitative analysis of protein expressions were performed using thresholding or kmeans clustering.  We have identified clusters of breast cancer cells based on co-expression patterns of ER, PgR and HER2 and observed significant levels of cellular heterogeneity particularly among the hormonal receptor-positive breast cancers.  In addition, certain clusters are either positively or negatively associated with TILs.  In ovarian cancer, TILs were labeled with proteins in the PD1-PDL1 checkpoint pathway and their co-expression patterns were examined.
