  Leukemia is the most common cancer in children. Down syndrome (DS), is a genetic disorder caused by the presence an extra copy of chromosome 21. Children born with DS have a 150-fold and 30-fold increased risk of developing acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), respectively, compared to healthy children. AMKL is preceded by a pre-leukemic syndrome termed transient leukemia (TL), which is characterized by high numbers of abnormal megakaryoblasts in the circulation, spleen and liver. While most TL cases spontaneously resolve, up to 15% of TL neonates can develop a lethal progressive liver fibrosis. Current dogma suggests that the initiation of TL requires only two genetic alterations, trisomy 21 and a mutation in the GATA1 transcription factor, resulting in the selective expansion of a TL blast population. Disease progression toward AMKL is associated with at least one additional mutation within the TL clone. What remains unclear is how an extra copy of chromosome 21 predisposes fetal liver HSC toward blood malignancy. Therefore, our objective is to understand why DS predisposes fetal liver HSC toward malignancy, to identify which cellular population undergoes oncogenic transformation, and to model DS hematopoiesis, and pre-leukemia to leukemia progression. The experimental insight and models generated will provide opportunities to meet the significant challenges of advancing drug development for leukemia in DS children.
