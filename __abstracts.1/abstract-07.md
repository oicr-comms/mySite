  Sensitive next generation sequencing (NGS) is of great importance for early cancer detection, monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD), and guiding precision oncology. Nevertheless, due to technical artefacts introduced during library preparation and sequencing steps as well as sub-optimal mutation calling analysis, the detection of variants with low allele frequency at high specificity is still problematic. Here we introduce a method that takes into account local sequence features to derive contextual error signatures. We demonstrate that Error Correction by Signatures Integration (ECSI), as compared with other advanced error correction techniques, is computationally simple and achieves more accurate mutation detection. Specifically, we observed reduction in false positive mutation calls within umbilical cord blood DNA, and greater analytical sensitivity without sacrificing specificity within cell line dilution series. We further demonstrated the method's clinical relevance and validated its superiority in detecting and monitoring MRD in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients during therapy. Finally, we showed that accurate mutation calling in a small number of informative genomic locations provides a cost-efficient strategic approach that can make screens for early AML detection more practical. More broadly, we anticipate that ECSI will aid in more accurate genotyping and detection of mutations in many other research and clinical settings.
