  Regional lymph node metastasis is a prevalent event in many tumour types and is pivotal for cancer staging, patient prognosis, and therapy design. However, despite its clinical significance, little is known about the rules governing the spread of cancer cells to nearby lymph nodes. Although the prevailing model suggests that lymph node metastasis gives rise to distance metastasis, thus supposing its evolutionary progression from the primary, recent studies showing evidence of distant metastasis bypassing the lymph nodes suggested that the spreading of cancer cells may be an early-arising and ongoing event. Here we examined the relationship between primary lesions and regional cervical lymph node metastasis in the context of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck, a disease that presents regional nodal involvement at diagnosis half of the time. Using whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, we characterised multiple lymph node metastases arising from eight patients. We observed evolutionary branching of metastatic lesions from the primary exemplified in novel functional mutations. More interestingly, we found evidence of the early emergence of lymph node metastasis, often deriving from a population that is ancestral to the population of the primary tumour. Our result sheds light on the intertwined history of primary head and neck tumours and their cervical lymph node metastasis, and furthers our understanding of the evolutionary trajectory of head and neck cancer.
