  Despite the effectiveness of anti-endocrine therapies in the treatment of early hormone receptor-positive breast cancers, there are still a significant number of women who experience a recurrence following such treatment. Using a subset of the randomized phase III, Tamoxifen and Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) trial, mRNA abundance analysis was performed in a case-control cohort of 350 patients using the 770-gene NanoString Pan-Cancer panel. We applied a pathway-based model using SIMMS package and identified a signature of 19 genes that could stratify and measure residual risk based on distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) with a hazard ratio of 3.15 (CI 95% 2.18-4.55, p=1.03E-9). The performance of the biomarkers was improved by using pathway information as functional modules resulting in a signature comprised of genes involved in apoptosis and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathways. Both univariate and multivariate analyses with clinical covariates showed that the gene signature was still prognostic. This novel prognostic signature could improve the clinical management of early hormone-receptor positive breast cancer by identifying those at risk for recurrence and provide insight to novel therapies targeting these genes and pathways.
