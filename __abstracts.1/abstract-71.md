  Many microbial strains are highly similar to one another, with small variations in their genomic sequence allowing differentiation between them. One way to better understand the composition and diversity of a microbial community is metagenomic assembly. Current tools for long read genome assembly are inadequate for metagenomic assembly of closely related strains with high sequence similarity. These tools collapse bubbles in assembly graphs. We propose that bubbles in assembly graphs can be used to aid identification of new strains and pinpoint regions of inter-strain sequence variation in a metagenomic sample. We developed a tool to efficiently assemble metagenomic samples, detecting and scoring bubbles in a metagenomic assembly graph based on their likelihood to be caused by strain variation. Our results show that bubbles are effective at identifying low coverage strains in a sample, and allow us to better understand the genomic make up of a metagenome. In addition we were able to show that long read metagenomic assembly can be done efficiently at scale without compromising genome assembly quality through the assembly of a large multi species and strain metagenomic sample.
