  Hematopoietic cells portray hierarchy of stem/progenitor and differentiated mature cells. Acquisition of mutations in stem/progenitor cells initiate AML. Studies have shown that mitochondrial enzymes regulate stemness by altering metabolites that affect epigenetic marks.  However, mitochondrial-metabolic enzymes in nucleus regulating stemness in AML and hematopoietic cells is unknown. 8227 leukemia cells are hierarchically arranged with functionally defined stem cells. Immunoblot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic lysates from sorted CD34+CD38- and CD34-CD38+ populations showed increased Hexokinase-2 in nuclear-fractions of stem cells compared to bulk cells. Nuclear HK2 was confirmed in 8227 cells by confocal microscopy and also demonstrated in other AML cell-lines and primary AML samples. IF analysis and quantification of FACS sorted normal cord blood revealed high nuclear HK2 in the stem/progenitor cells which progressively declined to minimal levels as the cells matured. PHLPP1 knockdown in AML2 decreased nuclear HK2, while AKT inhibition increased HK2 in nucleus. Over-expressing HK2 with nuclear localizing signals in 8227 and NB4 cells; enhanced clonogenic growth in NB4 and 8227 cells and induced resistance to retinoic acid-mediated differentiation revealing functional importance of nuclear-HK2. In summary, we discovered that the unphosphorylated HK2 localizes to the nucleus in malignant and normal hematopoietic stem cells and is functionally important in stemness.
