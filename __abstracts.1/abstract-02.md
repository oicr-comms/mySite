  The Genome Informatics team at OICR has produced three data portals of note: The Human Cancer Model Initiative (HCMI) Searchable Catalog, the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal, and the Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource Portal (KFDRP). The HCMI Searchable Catalog is an interactive catalog of purchasable next-generation, tumor-derived organoids and cell lines, supported by a custom content management system for entry and instant validation of clinical and genomic data.  Model information can be published instantly via sophisticated Elasticsearch document management. This creates a customized “shopping” experience for researchers to browse innovative cancer models annotated with genomic and clinical data. The GDC Data Portal has cancer genomic data from over 33K donors, and is updated with frequent releases of visualization and analysis tools such as visualizations for the co-occurrence of somatic mutations and copy number variations in a gene and mutation context, and histopathology image viewer. The Kids First DRP was developed with components from the Overture stack including OAuth2 authentication service EGO, data portal generator Arranger, user profile manager Persona, and URL shortener RIFF in a portal microservice architecture.  Data indexing on the KFDRP is supported by a dockerized ETL that allows for continuous data release at a project level by collaborators. The KFDRP forms a collaborative platform to focus on genomic analysis of pediatric genomes.
