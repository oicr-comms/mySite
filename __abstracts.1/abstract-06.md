  It has been well established that germline polymorphisms can influence cancer risk. For example, germline polymorphisms in RB1 account for 40% of retinoblastoma cases. Similarly germline polymorphisms in BRCA2 and KLK6 have been shown to induce change the somatic mutational landscape of prostate cancer. However, the global influence of germline differences on the somatic epigenetic landscape of cancer remains poorly understood. Here we present, the first systematic survey of the impact of germline genetics on the somatic epigenomic architecture of prostate cancer, relationships we term germline-epigenetic interactions. We identify >1,000 germline-epigenetic interactions with effects felt throughout the central dogma, i.e. modulating mRNA and protein abundance. This work establishes a larger role for germline genetics in tumourigenesis than previously thought.
