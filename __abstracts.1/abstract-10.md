  Mitochondrion biology has been shown to be of key importance in AML stemness and viability by our and other groups. Here we evaluate the mitochondrial IMS (inter membrane space) Assembly (MIA) pathway in regulation of AML stemness and differentiation. Targeting the FAD linked sulfhydryl oxidase ALR; an integral part of the MIA machinery by genetic or chemical approach using MitoBloCK-6 (MB6) lead to reduced growth and viability of AML cells along with decreased engraftment in-vivo. MB6 treatment of mice engrafted with primary AML cells strongly reduced the leukemic burden as oppose to no effect on engraftment of normal cord blood. As evidenced by secondary transplants, MB6 targeted leukemic stem cells. Cox17 was recognised as the primary downstream target of ALR in leukemic cells and knockdown of Cox17 phenocopied ALR inhibition causing reduced AML proliferation and induced AML differentiation. MB6 treatment of AML cells increased intra-mitochondrial levels of copper 2.5 fold as measured by atomic mass spectrometry. Copper a known inhibitor of adenosylhomocysteinase (AHCY), shifted the balance of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM):S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) ratio, causing SAM  (a global methyl donor) levels to go down and resulting in DNA hypomethylation and co-treatment with the copper chelator penicillamine reversed all these phenotypes. Thus, we have discovered a novel copper-dependent mechanism by which mitochondrial pathways regulate epigenetics and stemness in AML.
