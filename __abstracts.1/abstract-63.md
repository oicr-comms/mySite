  We previously identified a 17-gene leukemia stem cell (LSC) signature that is strongly associated with clinical outcomes and predicts treatment response in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The top weighted gene in the LSC17 score is DNMT3B, an enzyme that catalyzes de novo methylation of CpG dinucleotides.
  
  The early steps of leukemogenesis are characterized by deregulations of epigenetic processes, with frequent mutations in epigenetic regulating genes (ex. TET2, DNMT3A, IDH1/2).
  
  The major role of DNMT3B has been evidenced through Immunodeficiency-centromeric instability facial anomalies 1 (ICF1) syndrome, characterized by DNMT3B mutations. ICF1 patients show a massive deregulation of methylation, associated with chromosome decondensation causing chromosome breaks and rearrangements in lymphocytes. However, no link between DNMT3B and chromosomal instability had been evidenced in the context of leukemia.
  
  Here we show that the expression of specific forms of DNMT3B affects methylation and in 3 AML cohorts (n=300 patients) is highly associated with chromosomal instability defined by complex cytogenetic. DNMT3B is also over-expressed in a broad range of cancers including colorectal, pancreatic cancers and glioblastoma, suggesting broader role of DNMT3B beyond AML.
  
  This work may also reveal novel therapeutic approaches through pharmacologic manipulation of methylation to prevent chromosomal instability and its high adaptation/resistance to chemotherapies.
