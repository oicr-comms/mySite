  Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common brain tumour in adults, is propagated by a population of cells with stem-like properties (CSCs); GBM is incurable. Indeed, a stem-like gene expression profile correlates with a poor clinical outcome across many malignancies. Since normal adult stem cells (ASCs) and CSCs share many properties, such as self-renewing cell divisions, we took a comparative genomics approach by using the planarian flatworm Schmidtea mediterranea as an in vivo model system to elucidate key drivers of cancer pathology. We have identified 87 stem cell specific genes in S. mediterranea that are conserved in mammals and significantly over-expressed in GBM CSCs.  RNAi screens demonstrate a high (40%) incidence of organismal lethality due to a defective stem cell population. One of these genes, a highly conserved RNA helicase, DDX56, is upregulated in ~20% of human GBMs, and its upregulation alone is clinically prognostic. Using an inducible CRISPR knockout approach, we demonstrate that DDX56 is critical for GBM CSC proliferation and self-renewal. Also, in a Drosophila model of GBM, we show knockdown of the fly homolog (Hlc) can completely suppress the glial tumour phenotype in vivo. Finally, we investigate the role DDX56 and its role in stemness during mouse brain development. Altogether, this work demonstrates the utility of comparative genomics by providing insight into ancestral pluripotency regulatory systems to identify novel drivers of cancer.
