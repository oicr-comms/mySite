   The Ontario Health Study (OHS), the largest contributor to the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow Project (CPTP), is a prospective, population-based study that serves as a platform to investigate environmental, lifestyle, clinical and genetic factors associated with cancer and other chronic diseases. The OHS provides an abundant source of population health data, biosamples and associated biosample data. Over 225,000 participants enrolled in the OHS and completed the baseline questionnaire, and over 90% of participants consented to data linkage. Validation of self-reported cancer diagnoses have captured incident cases since participants first registered. Over 40,000 participants provided biological samples, and physical measurements were collected from ~13,000. Genotyping with the UK Biobank array will be completed for ~6,400 participants and biomarkers for ~2,000 are currently being analyzed. A subset of ~450 participants are undergoing single-cell RNA sequencing. MRIs have been collected from over 3,000 OHS participants, the largest collection in Canada. Approximately 4,000 participants are expected to contribute actigraphy and quantitative measures of sleep to a multi-cohort study, and ~47,000 participants took part in the follow-up questionnaire. A rich and unique resource for researchers investigating cancer and other chronic diseases, de-identified data, biosamples, and associated biosample data are now available.
