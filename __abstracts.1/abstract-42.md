   Masking in mammography is the reduction of lesion conspicuity by surrounding and overlying dense tissue, which reduces mammographic sensitivity, especially in dense breasts. We have developed masking indices that can predict the likelihood of a masked cancer and could be used in a screening program to stratify women at greatest risk of masking to alternative imaging. The study population included 44 non-screen detected (interval) cancers cases, 70 screen-detected cancers cases and 1897 cancer-free controls. BI-RADS density, volumetric breast density (VBD) and detectability (d') were collected for each mammogram. Stepwise logistic regressions were performed to build models for predicting masking risk on interval (masked) and screen-detected (non-masked) cases. A separate model was developed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on VGG-16. Masking indices based on BI-RADS, VBD + d' and CNN yielded AUCs of 0.67, 0.79 and 0.79, respectively. To simulate a stratified screening program, the masking indices were tested on the mammograms from cancer-free controls to estimate the fraction of women that would be recruited to supplemental imaging. As baseline for stratified screening, using the BI-RADS density classifier would require a recruitment of 1140 (BI-RADS 4 only) and 1117 (BI-RADS 3 + 4) women per interval cancer found. In comparison, the VBD + d' masking index reduced the burden to only 374 and 725 supplemental screens per interval cancer detected.
