    This personal practice website was created as a web development exercise in May 2019.

    The author, Amy McCormack, had an awesome experience researching and creating this website about cats since looking at cats all day is a pretty good time. Although, unfortunately due to time restrictions only the cutest cats immediately found had made the cut and were chosen to be featured as one of the nine total cat breeds displayed on this website.

    All cat and kitten breed information displayed on this site was referenced from <a href="https://cattime.com/cat-breeds">_cattime.com_</a>.
